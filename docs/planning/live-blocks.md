# Live blocks

## 0. Batt's words (2026-11-13 ~21:4x, Thai, translated)

- "Build the player of blocks in the real game first. Take every box out of the page: START >
  map xmas_dun02, ONE box is enough. Then build this box's flow, put EVERYTHING the bot has
  trained to play into it. We start from only this. Login and choosing the character come later.
  Start simple."
- "If someone wants to try this bot program, the user must put the character on xmas_dun02
  themself."
- "On the Maps page add a Run button too: it runs from START, box by box."
- Asked how the hunt should appear, Batt chose: BREAK THE RUNNER INTO BLOCKS (each technique a
  block the player plays), over keeping it one block; he was told it is days to weeks and that the
  hunt must not play worse until each piece is proven again.

## 1. What exists

- The flow engine (packages/poring_flow) SIMULATES: runtime.py's tree runtime runs a fake
  environment and emits the input batches a real run would send; ADR-0020's real executor
  (F2 / MW2) is not built. The run-start check (runstart.py, MW3) exists.
- The game is played by scripts/dungeon_hunt.py `run()`: ONE function of 4,044 lines whose loop
  holds every technique (the export scripts/runner_flow_export.py describes it as ~70 blocks:
  look, safety, boxes, engage, choose, approach, still, lead, strike, loot, explore, walk, the
  Knife swap's two functions, the respawn function, the safety rules: stock out, a dead jump, the
  Fly Wing on HP, the potion, the Garm Baby, the boss, the weight, an unread position, the NPC
  guard).
- Run today: the browser asks the host's Run helper (scripts/flow_run.py) to start the runner as
  a process, in player mode, with the flow's keys and the server's settings.

## 2. The stages (each one proven before the next; the hunt never plays worse)

| Stage | What becomes blocks | Proven by |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | The ONE-BOX project (START > xmas_dun02). The LIVE BLOCK PLAYER: press key, wait, wait until (HP, weight, dead, the map's name: pixels), if / while / repeat, functions with inputs, variables, events, stop, the item warp by a function (its arrival read on the minimap). The hunt core as ONE block played IN-PROCESS (the runner's loop as a library with a tick hook: one process, one input writer). Run on /flows and on /maps (from START, box by box). | offline: fakes prove the input it sends; live: Batt's OK, she placed on xmas_dun02 by a person |
| 2 | SURVIVAL out of the runner into the box's EVENTS (functions with a trigger, section 2a): heal (F1 at HP < 30 %), the Fly Wing (F8 on a boss or HP < 25 %), stock out, the dead jump, the Garm Baby, an unread position. The runner's own handler is switched off for each one the box plays (its flags exist: `flow_config.py`); the event plays through the tick hook. | live A/B against the monolithic runner: deaths, potions, flies, kills/h |
| 3 | The Knife swap as two FUNCTIONS of presses and a wait (section 2a), the respawn, the weight home, the end | live A/B: steals, swaps, respawn, home |
| 4+ | The CORE as PRIMITIVE blocks + ONE FUNCTION PER MONSTER (attack_myst_case, attack_cookie, ...; section 2a), and use_model (the trained data) | live A/B each: kills/h, loot/h, zeny/h, deaths (Batt's own run is the bar) |

## 2a. Batt's shape for stages 2-4 (2026-11-13 ~22:0x, Thai, translated)

"Heal, Fly Wing, Knife swap: write every one of them as a FUNCTION, don't make one block.
Heal: press F1 (the White Potion) when HP < 30 %. Fly Wing: press F8 when a boss is seen or
HP < 25 %. The Knife swap (Damascus): a function: press F4, wait 100 ms, press F5; the other way
back to the Knife: the same swapped. The flow page should also have a block to LOAD THE TRAINED
DATA (I saw you made one), with the monsters the bot already knows. The core of the hunt (look,
choose a target, walk up, strike, loot, explore): break it into functions, never one block, e.g.
attack_myst_case, attack_cookie, because in the future each monster may get a different skill or
killing technique, and on some we may not swap the knife at all."

So the box is written like this (a sketch; the spellings are the engine's):

    # tab survival: events are functions with a trigger
    @on(hp_percent() < 30, mode=INSERT)       def heal():      press_key("F1")   # White Potion
    @on(boss_seen() or hp_percent() < 25)     def fly_away():  press_key("F8")   # Fly Wing
    # tab knife
    def knife_to_damascus():  press_key("F4"); wait(0.1); press_key("F5")
    def damascus_to_knife():  ...the same, swapped
    # tab monsters: one function per monster, each its own technique
    def attack_myst_case(t):  knife_to_damascus(); strike(t); wait_kill(t); damascus_to_knife(); loot(t)
    def attack_cookie(t):     strike(t); wait_kill(t); loot(t)               # no knife swap
    # tab main
    use_model("xmas02")                       # the trained data: the monsters the bot knows
    while weight_percent() < 50:
        t = choose_target()
        if t is mystcase: attack_myst_case(t)
        elif t is cookie: attack_cookie(t)
        else: explore()

- The PRIMITIVE live blocks the runner is broken into (each the runner's own code behind it):
  use_model(model) (the trained data; its classes become the monsters the other blocks name),
  choose_target() / nearest(class) (a monster as a value), walk_to_target(t), strike(t),
  wait_kill(t), loot(t), explore(), use_skill(key) (a press), plus the sensors (hp, weight,
  boss_seen, sees(class), dead, the map's name).
- Every key in a function; every threshold in an event's condition; every technique per monster
  in that monster's function: nothing of it a setting hidden in one block.

## 3. Stage 1 in detail

- The project: `start` may be a MAP node (the run starts where she stands on it); login /
  character nodes become optional (later). The ready-made project is ONE box, xmas_dun02 (entry
  "here"), with its tabs: main, keys (every key a function), and the parts of the hunt as they
  become blocks.
- The player: a host program (scripts/flow_play.py), started by the Run helper like the runner;
  it compiles the project (poring_flow.project), runs the engine's tree runtime with a LIVE
  environment (real clock, pixel sensors, real input through ro_agent's Agent: the mux, the
  foreground gate, the UI gate), and refuses BEFORE ANY INPUT a block that has no live binding
  (the run-start check names it). Player mode: it types no GM line.
- One input writer: the hunt core block runs in the SAME process with the same Agent; while it
  runs, the box's events reach the game only through its tick hook.
- Stop: as Run's today (the stop file); the player releases what it holds and ends.
- The start: the start check (chat closed, the map's name read as the run's map, the stock on the
  right keys) refuses before any input: the person places her on the map.

## 4. Not in stage 1

Login, choose character, walk_to on the live player, talk to NPC, the shop / Kafra blocks.

## 5. The night of 2026-11-13 (Batt: "plan a long night, go on without me; I read it tomorrow")

In order; each step only after the one before is proven; nothing of the hunt plays worse:

1. Merge stage 1 (the live player, the one box, Run on /maps and /flows) and the slot item check
   (dungeon@9.47: a role key holding another item refuses the start); every suite green; deploy
   (backend, Run helper); the minimap and slot references built on main.
2. Live stage 1, short: place her on xmas_dun02 with the lab's setup tool (a GM @warp line, the
   setup's, as this afternoon), the start check all ✓, Run the one-box project for 10 min through
   the new player, Stop: she flies home. Compare with the runner's own numbers (kills/h, loot,
   deaths, potions). The Stormy Knight's schedule is checked first (memory: the MVP).
3. Stage 2: heal and the Fly Wing as the box's EVENTS (section 2a) through the tick hook; the
   runner's own potion and fly switched off where the box plays them; offline tests; live A/B
   (the runner vs the box), alternating runs, as many pairs as the night allows.
4. Stage 3: the Knife swap as functions, the respawn, the weight home (the Knife question in the
   report for Batt: the strike between F4 and F5, or not).
5. Stage 4 begins: use_model (the trained data block) and the first primitives (choose_target,
   strike, wait_kill, loot, explore) with one function per monster for the two most common
   monsters; offline first; live only once the A/B of stage 2 holds.
6. matpilot re-reviews the pages (read only); its findings fixed.
7. The report for Batt in the morning: every run's numbers, what was proven, what is not.
